        "# Tuples\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are a versatile data structure in Python that allow you to store multiple elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. Here's a beginner-friendly tutorial on tuples in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Creating a Tuple:\n",
        "   To create a tuple, you enclose comma-separated values within parentheses `()`. Alternatively, you can use the `tuple()` function to create a tuple. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Empty tuple\n",
        "   my_tuple = ()\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Tuple with values\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Using the tuple() function\n",
        "   my_tuple = tuple([1, 2, 3])\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Accessing Tuple Elements:\n",
        "   You can access elements in a tuple using indexing, similar to lists. The index starts from 0 for the first element. Additionally, you can use negative indexing to access elements from the end of the tuple. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1\n",
        "   print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 5\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Tuple Slicing:\n",
        "   Like lists, you can use slicing to access a range of elements in a tuple. Slicing returns a new tuple containing the specified elements. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(my_tuple[1:3])  # Output: (2, 3)\n",
        "   print(my_tuple[2:])  # Output: (3, 4, 5)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Tuple Unpacking:\n",
        "   Tuple unpacking allows you to assign individual elements of a tuple to separate variables. This can be useful when working with functions that return multiple values as a tuple. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "   a, b, c = my_tuple\n",
        "   print(a)  # Output: 1\n",
        "   print(b)  # Output: 2\n",
        "   print(c)  # Output: 3\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tuple Methods:\n",
        "   Tuples provide a few built-in methods to perform common operations:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `count(value)`: Returns the number of occurrences of a value in the tuple.\n",
        "   - `index(value)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in the tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3\n",
        "   print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 3\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Iterating Over a Tuple:\n",
        "   You can use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of a tuple, similar to lists. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "   for element in my_tuple:\n",
        "       print(element)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Immutable Nature:\n",
        "   Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. However, you can create new tuples by concatenating or slicing existing tuples. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "   new_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5)\n",
        "   print(new_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "These are the basic concepts of tuples\n",
        "\n",

        "In Python, control flow refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program. It allows you to make decisions and repeat sections of code based on certain conditions. Python provides several control flow statements to facilitate this process. The main control flow statements in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else):\n",
        "   Conditional statements allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions. The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. Optionally, you can use `elif` (short for \"else if\") to check additional conditions, and `else` to provide a fallback option if none of the previous conditions are true. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 10\n",
        "   if x > 0:\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Loops:\n",
        "   Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python provides two types of loops: `for` and `while`.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `for` loop: It iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object. The loop variable takes on each value in the sequence. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "     for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "         print(fruit)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `while` loop: It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     i = 0\n",
        "     while i < 5:\n",
        "         print(i)\n",

        "   Python provides some keywords to modify the flow of control within loops and conditional statements.\n",

        "   - `break`: Terminates the current loop and continues execution at the next statement outside the loop.\n",
        "   - `continue`: Skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
        "   - `pass`: It acts as a placeholder and does nothing. It is commonly used as a placeholder for code that will be implemented later.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here's an example that demonstrates the use of these keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   for i in range(10):\n",
        "       if i == 3:\n",
        "           continue\n",
        "       elif i == 7:\n",
        "           break\n",
        "       else:\n",
        "           pass\n",
        "       print(i)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Exception Handling (try, except, finally):\n",
        "   Exception handling is used to catch and handle errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution. It helps in gracefully handling errors and prevents the program from crashing. The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the `except` block catches and handles the specific exception(s). The `finally` block is optional and is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       x = 10 / 0  # Raises a ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
        "   finally:\n",
        "       print(\"This is always executed\")\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "# Dictionaries\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries are a powerful data structure in Python that store data in key-value pairs. They are mutable, unordered, and allow quick access to values based on their corresponding keys. Here's a beginner-friendly tutorial on Python dictionaries:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Creating a Dictionary:\n",
        "   To create a dictionary, you enclose comma-separated key-value pairs within curly braces `{}`. Each key is followed by a colon `:` and its corresponding value. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Empty dictionary\n",
        "   my_dict = {}\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Accessing Values:\n",
        "   You can access the values in a dictionary by using the corresponding keys inside square brackets `[]`. If a key doesn't exist, it will raise a `KeyError`. Alternatively, you can use the `get()` method, which returns `None` if the key doesn't exist (or a default value if provided). Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "   print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: John\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Using get() method\n",
        "   print(my_dict.get(\"age\"))  # Output: 30\n",
        "   print(my_dict.get(\"country\"))  # Output: None\n",
        "   print(my_dict.get(\"country\", \"Unknown\"))  # Output: Unknown\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Modifying and Adding Elements:\n",
        "   Dictionaries are mutable, so you can modify the values of existing keys or add new key-value pairs. To modify a value, access it using its key and assign a new value. To add a new key-value pair, assign a value to a new key that doesn't exist in the dictionary. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_dict = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",

        "   my_dict[\"age\"] = 35  # Modifying an existing value\n",

        "\n",
        "   print(my_dict)\n",
        "   # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 35, 'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA'}\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Dictionary Methods:\n",
        "   Python provides several built-in methods to perform common operations on dictionaries:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `keys()`: Returns a view object containing all the keys.\n",
        "   - `values()`: Returns a view object containing all the values.\n",
        "   - `items()`: Returns a view object containing all the key-value pairs as tuples.\n",
        "   - `pop(key)`: Removes and returns the value associated with the given key.\n",
        "   - `popitem()`: Removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair as a tuple.\n",
        "   - `update(other_dict)`: Updates the dictionary with the key-value pairs from another dictionary.\n",
        "   - `clear()`: Removes all the elements from the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here's an example:\n",

        "   ```python\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Calling a Function:\n",
        "   To execute the code inside a function, you need to call it by using its name followed by parentheses `()`. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   greet()  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Function Parameters:\n",
        "   Functions can accept input values called parameters or arguments. You specify parameters inside the parentheses when defining the function. When calling the function, you pass the corresponding values as arguments. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name):\n",
        "       print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Return Statement:\n",
        "   Functions can return values using the `return` statement. This allows you to obtain results or computed values from a function. The `return` statement terminates the function execution and sends the specified value back to the caller. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "       return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "   result = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Default Parameters:\n",
        "   You can define default parameter values in a function by assigning them a value in the function definition. If an argument is not provided when calling the function, the default value will be used. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def greet(name=\"world\"):\n",
        "       print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   greet()  # Output: Hello, world!\n",
        "   greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Variable Number of Arguments:\n",
        "   Functions in Python can accept a variable number of arguments. You can use `*args` to pass a non-keyworded variable-length argument list or `**kwargs` to pass a keyworded variable-length argument list. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add_numbers(*args):\n",
        "       total = 0\n",
        "       for num in args:\n",
        "           total += num\n",
        "       return total\n",
        "\n",
        "   result = add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: 10\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Docstrings:\n",
        "   It's good practice to include a docstring in your functions. A docstring is a string that provides a description of the function's purpose, parameters, and return value. It helps other developers understand and use your functions correctly. Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "       \"\"\"Adds two numbers and returns the sum.\"\"\"\n",
        "       return a + b\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "These are the basic concepts of functions in Python. By utilizing functions, you can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, promote code reuse, and improve the overall structure of your programs.\n",

        "To read file data into a 2D list in Python, you can modify the previous approach by splitting each line into individual elements and appending them as a sublist in the main list. Here's an example:\n",

        "# Read the file content into a 2D list\n",
        "two_d_list = []\n",
        "for line in file:\n",
        "    line = line.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace\n",
        "    elements = line.split(\",\")  # Split the line into elements using a delimiter (e.g., comma)\n",

        "    print(sublist)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, each line from the file is split using the `split()` method, assuming a comma (\",\") as the delimiter. You can replace it with any other delimiter based on your file's format. The resulting elements are then appended as a sublist in the `two_d_list`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to replace `\"file.txt\"` with the actual path to your file. After reading the file into the `two_d_list`, you can perform various operations on it, such as accessing individual elements using indexing (`two_d_list[row_index][column_index]`).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that if your file contains non-numeric data that needs to be converted to a specific type (e.g., integers or floats), you can apply type conversion on the elements before appending them to the sublist.\n",
